# Concurrent Programming
 Concurrent programming is a programming paradigm that allows multiple tasks to execute simultaneously. It is different from sequential programming, where tasks are executed one after another. Concurrent programming is often used to improve the performance of programs by allowing multiple tasks to be processed at the same time.
